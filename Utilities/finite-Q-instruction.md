#Two Methods for Finite Q Calculations

## 1. Exciton Dispersion Along specific Q-points

Instructions: calculate BSE for any Q-points
Required input: in_head/pp_in (2.1-wfn), inq_head/pp_inq(2.2-wfnq), kgrid.inp, kpt.dat(4-path/WFN, this is actually Q-grid you want)

(1) go to **1-mf** and run _fiinte_any_Q_DFT.py_, then run **go.sh** generated by last step

(2) go to **2-bgw** and run _finite_any_Q_BGW.py_. then run **go.sh** in **5-exciton-Q** by last step.

(3) use _finite_Q_get_data.py_ to collect data

## 2. Exciton Dispersion in Uniform Q-grid (usually for EX-PH)

Instructions: calculate BSE for a uniform Q-grid
Required input: 1-mf/4.1-wfn_co_fullgrid/WFN

(1) Run _finite_uniform_Q_BSE.py_ in **2-bgw/**, make sure **1-mf/4.1-wfn_co_fullgrid** exists, which includes WFN where contains uniform Q-grid.

(2) then run **go.sh** in **5_Q** generated by last step

(3) Then, go to IO_acv.py and copy the first command lines to get acvs.save (you can then use _finite_Q_get_data.py_ to collect exciton energy)
