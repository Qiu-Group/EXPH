Progress need to do:

(1) add some test code

(2) add a function, which can give the index of Q q k_acv and k_gkk once we determine the point value
(not hurry)

(3) check BE distribution: since when omega = 0, BE will goes to divergence. discuss this with Diana

(4) think some better solution for kmap (float issue)
