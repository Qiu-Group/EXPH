### 2. Finite-Q Exciton from BGW
In this step, we will use BGW to generate finite-Q exciton wavefunction A(c,v,S,Q,k) and exciton dispersion on a uniform 
Q-grid (such as 18\*18\*1), which will be used in later exciton-phonon matrix calculation.


- DFT (QE)  
  (1) What are we doing here?
  
  In order to diagonalize the finite-Q BSE, we need two sets of k-grid: one is unshifted k-grid and the other is shifted 
  k-grid. The shifted vector is exactly negative momentum Q of exciton.

  Since a uniform Q-grid is needed in the further exciton-phonon calculation, we need to generate a lot of shifted k-grid WFN 
  (they will be stored in *./4.2-wfnq_co-n/WFN*) corresponding to all Q points in the 1st BZ of exciton. And all finite-Q BSE 
  could share same unshifted k-grid, we only need to generate one unshifted WFN (it will be stored in *./4.1-wfn_co_fullgrid/WFN*). 
  
  It seems pretty troublesome right? Don't worry, I have already written some scripts to help you automatically doing this!
   
   BTW: I think there is no bug here, but please do sanity check for every step and contact Bowen if you find anything weired.
  
  (2) Practical Steps

  - `cd 3-exciton-band/1-mf`, and you will find 6 files:
    - ***in_head***: input of pw.x for unshifted k-grid (you can think this is input of *2.1-wfn/* Q=0 calculation). There is **no** 
    'KPOINTS' set in this file, which will be generated by script automatically (so this file is called 'in_head'). If you 
    want to set kpoints by yourself to do sanity check or debug, please **DO NOT** apply symmetry.
    - ***inq_head***: input of pw.x for shifted k-grid. You don't have to set *KPOINTS* by yourself either, my script will help you
    automatically set it based on what you write in *kpt.dat*.
    - ***pp_in***: input of pw2bgw.x for unshfited k-grid (in_head)
    - ***pp_inq***: input of pw2bgw.x for shifted k-grid (inq_head)
    - ***kpt.dat***: list of all shift vectors, which is corresponding to **Q-points** you want to calculate later 
    (usually, this is a uniform grid, e.g. here is a 3\*3\*1 Q(negative shift)-grid). Remember: **do not apply symmetry** due to some gauge issue
    (further study needed here)
    - ***kgrid.inp***: input of kgrid.x, used to generate unshifted kgrid and the empirically 24\*24\*1 is good enough to converge 
    MoS2 BSE calculation.
    
  - Firstly run DFT calculation for 2.1-wfn and 2.2-wfnq (Please modify QEPATH and BGWPATH in *go0.sh*.). This step is used to generate WFN to do inteqp.cplx.x in the 
  later finite-Q exciton calculation (BSE with different Q needs different eqp.dat, which is generated by interpolating eqp.dat for 
  shifted gird based on unshifted grid.).  
  `sbatch go0.sh`  
  this may last 30s if you use -N 2 -n 112.  
   **In reality, you can link the directory you have done in the standard
  GW+BSE calculation, and you don't have to redo it**
  - execute this in command line:  
  `finite_Q_get_data.py`  
  go to several files to double check if everything seems normal.
  - run DFT calculation (modify number of nodes, number of mpi-task and QE path before you run it):  
  `sbatch go.sh`  
  this may last 2 minutes if you use -N 10 -n 560
  
 
- GW + BSE (BGW)  
  (1) What are we doing in this step?
 
  In this step, we will generate finite-Q exciton wavefunction by diagonalizing finite-Q BSE based on Q-points you set in
  */3-exciton-band/1-mf/kpt.dat*. Note: this step is really **expensive**, please make sure everything is right before you 
  do it.
  
  (2) Practical Steps
  
  - `cd 3-exciton-band/2-bgw/` and you will find 2 directories:  
    - ***1-epsilon***: this directory includes *epsmat.h5* and *eps0mat.h5*, which will be used in later BSE. Please do this
    calculation with a **small** cutoff energy (e.g. 7 Ry) with WFN generated in *../1-mf/2.1-wfn* and *../1-mf/2.2-wfnq* (but 
    you don't need to do that in this example).     
    **IMPORTANT**: please recalculate this with a very small cutoff energy (e.g. 7 Ry), even if you have already generated
    1-epsilon in your standard calculation. Because BSE calculation is pretty expensive, if you use epsmat.h5 generated in
    your standard calculation with large cutoff (25 Ry e.g.), it will make finite Q exciton calculation impossible to be finished
    (we usually need 24\*24\*1 Q-grid i.e. 576 BSE calculation). However, luckily BSE calculation is not sensitive to cutoff
    energy in epsmat.h5 (I have also verified it), so we can use *epsmat.h5* with small cutoff energy safely.
    - ***2-bgw***: this directory includes *eqp.dat*, which will be used in later for interpolation. Luckily, you don't have 
    to recalculate it, just use your standard GW result (make sure k-grid here is the same as *../1-mf/2.1-wfn*).
  
  - execute this in command line to generate necessary directories and input files (the first "2" is number of conduction bands
  in kernel.inp and the second "2" is number of valence band in kernel.inp):  
  `finite_any_Q_BSE.py 2 2`
  
  - go to *./5-exciton-Q* just generated by finite_an_Q_BSE.py  
  `cd ./5-exciton-Q`  
  and you will find a bunch of directories including *inteqp* and *Q-n*.
    - ***kpt***: Q-shift for this BSE
    - ***inteqp***: this includes interpolated eqp.dat for *4.1-wfn_co_fullgrid/WFN*, which will be referred as *eqp_co.dat* later
    - ***Q-n***: BSE for each finite Q-exciton
      - ***5.0-inteqp-Q***: this includes interpolated eqp.dat for *4.2-wfnq_co-9/WFN*, which will be referred as *eqp_co_q.dat* later
      - ***5.1-kernel-Q***: finite Q-exciton BSE kernel
      - ***5.2-absorp-Q***: this will generate eigenvector.h5 file for
  
  - run finite-Q exciton BSE (before you run, modify path and parallel parameters.):    
  ``cd ../``  
  ``sbatch go.sh``  
  it might last 8 minutes if you use -N 10 -n 560
